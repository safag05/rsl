            <h2>GAME RULES</h2>
            <ul>
                
                <li>Please always keep in mind, this is a league for FUN! Please avoid fights and respect each other.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Games will be played 7 vs 7 including goalies!!!</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Substitute rules:</strong> Anyone from the bench can change players at their will, BUT the players who are making the change, please yell "CHANGE" so that other players are informed. Substitutes, please DO NOT enter the field until your teammate is out of the field.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Every player must arrive at least 10 minutes before their game. Every player must leave the field on time, and the next team must be ready to enter the field and ready for the game to start.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Every player must bring one black and one white T-shirt. (NO GRAY; gray can confuse all players.) Unless we have jerseys, this is the best solution to separate the two teams.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Outdoor soccer cleats are NOT preferred to prevent any damage to the field or cause any injury. Indoor turf soccer shoes or running shoes are preferred.</li>
                <br>
                <li>No throw-ins. Side walls are NOT considered out of play. If the ball hits the side walls, we will continue playing. However, the back of the goal is considered out/corner.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Hand Positions -</strong> Hand positions are the hardest to resolve. Some may see it as a handball, while another person may say it didn't touch their hand. We must first acknowledge the defender player's honesty. If the defender (the person whose hand may have touched the ball) says it didn't touch, we just have to believe them unless the majority of people, including teammates, agree that it is a handball. If the spot is inside the box, it will be a penalty. Even though the defender is honest, sometimes the player themselves may not feel it due to the anxiety of the game. This is the only time when the majority matters.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Each team will play each other once. Then, the first half and second half of the teams on the points table will be split into two groups. Then, every team will play each other once within their respective groups. </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Point System:</strong> Win = 3 Points; Draw = 1 Point; Lose = 0 Point</li>
                <br>
                <li>If any team finishes with the same number of points, their position in the league is determined by the goal difference in the head-to-head matches. If the goal difference is the same in the two head-to-head games, then it will be determined by the general goal difference statistics. If the general goal difference statistics are also the same, the team that has scored more goals will be ahead.</li>
                <br>
                <li>You can only play on one team during the tournament. The only way a person can switch to another team is PERMANENTLY. And you must tell both Team Leaders in each team. And you can only switch to another team ONLY ONCE!!! The reason for allowing it one time can be due to unhappiness with the current team for any reason, but once you switch, you either keep playing on that team or quit the tournament until the next tournament!!!</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>YELLOW card</strong> - 5 Minutes out<br><strong>RED card</strong> - 10 minutes out<br><strong>2nd RED is permanent out for the game!!!</strong><br>Meanwhile NO SUB can enter for him!!! The team will play one player less.<br>Card calls will be determined by the referee.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>NO SLIDING TACKLE!!!</strong><br>Result can be a warning, YELLOW OR RED depending on the severeness in the referee's view.</li>
